<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 Chicken Breasts</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Turkish Spice Blend</li>
<li>1 oz Almonds, sliced</li>
<li>3/4 cup Basmati Rice</li>
<li>12 oz Sweet Potato</li>
<li>2 oz Onion, chopped</li>
<li>100 mL Greek Yogurt</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Parsley</li>
<li>1 Lemon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Garlic Salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 cup Chicken Broth</li>
<li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut sweet potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces. Combine and toss sweet potatoes, half the onions, half the garlic salt, and a tablespoon of oil. Lay to a baking sheet and roast on the middle rack of the oven, stirring halfway through until golden brown (12-22 mins).</li>
<li>While sweet potatoes roast, heat a medium pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add a tablespoon of oil and remaining onions. Cook, stirring often until fragrant (1 min). Add chicken broth and rice, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and leave covered until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed (12-14 mins). Remove pot from heat, still covered.</li>
<li>While rice cooks, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add almonds to the dry pan. Toast, stirring occasionally until golden brown (2-3 mins). When almonds are done, transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
<li>While almonds toast, pat chicken dry with paper towel. Sprinkle with Turkish Spice blend and the remaining garlic salt. Season with pepper. With the pan used in the last step, increase heat to medium-high. Add a tablespoon of oil and the chicken. Pan-fry until golden brown (1-2 min per side). Transfer chicken to another baking sheet. Roast on the top rack of the oven until chicken is cooked through (10-12 mins).</li>
<li>While chicken roasts, zest and juice half the lemon. Cut remaining lemon into wedges. Roughly chop parsley. Add yogurt, half the parsley, sugar, lemon zest and juice to a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, and whisk to combine.</li>
<li>Fluff rice with a fork, then stir in almonds and remaining parsley. Slice chicken. Divide rice between plates, then top with sweet potatoes and chicken. Spoon yogurt sauce over top. Squeeze over a lemon wedge, as desired.</li>

<li>1-2 glasses wine (whatever you have open)</li>
<li>1 glass of milk (optional)</li>
<li>1 glass of beef/vegetable stock (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Finely dice the carrots, celery, onion and pancetta, if your blender can handle it you can optionally blend all this to speed it up.</li>
<li>Heat up a large saucepan or dutch oven on medium low heat and put enough olive oil in to cover the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>Put in your diced veggies and pancetta and let it slowly saut√© for about 10 minutes until everything is fragrant and soft.</li>
<li>If you are using garlic add it here and let it sweat for a minute</li>
<li>Add in your minced meat and break it up into small clumps about the size of a rice grain with a spoon, keep stiring until all your meat is lightly cooked.</li>
<li>Once all your meat is cooked and looks a bit grey add your wine, add enough to fully deglaze the pan (I usually add a little bit extra for the flavor)
stir it through until it has completely evaporated. (If you are using it you can also add the stock at this point)</li>
<li>Once your pan is somewhat dry you can add the tomato paste to the beef, let it cook for a minute to remove the slight metallic taste.</li>
<li>Add your canned and peeled tomatoes and use your spoon to break them up, you don't have to be too thorough since they will soften up while the sauce cooks.</li>
<li>add the diced tomatoes, fill the jar your tomatoes came in with water give it a shake and add that to the pot, do the same with your can of peeled tomatoes.</li>
<li>lower your heat to the lowest setting and slightly cover the pan with your lid.</li>
<li>let it simmer for as long as you can wait, preferably at least 4 hours, if it starts getting a bit too dry you can add a bit more water to make sure the sauce doesn't burn.</li>
<li>Once it's done simmering for as long as you can muster and its nice and thick, the liquid should not come above your meat and should be pretty concentrated</li>
<li>You can add your glass of milk, let it simmer for 10 more minutes and serve.</li>

UPDATE recipe:1giblx3od6g63e8ehqe9 CONTENT { author: 'shou-ganai', date: '2021-03-16', html: "<p>Aljotta (&quot;jo&quot; as in &quot;Yo!&quot;) is a traditional Maltese light fish soup with roots in french bouillabaisse and similarly refers to the method of serving the fish that are cooked in it. The most appropriate fish to use for both the stock and the accompanying meal are 'clean' white fish that don't turn the broth cloudy, ideally stargazers, monkfish, red gurnard, and moray eels but also hake, mullets, cod and haddock. There are a some variants; restaurant versions could very well include lemon juice and shellfish which I don't associate with aljotta. Rice eventually became a staple with it and how much you put in is up to you. I recommend just a little. In fact, there are no ingredient amounts; the picture should give you an idea of the density you're going for. <strong>Fresh herbs are a must</strong>.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

<li>Fish, raw</li>
<li>Onion, roughly chopped</li>
<li>Garlic, sliced or diced</li>
<li>Tomatos, chopped</li>

<li>Mint, small amount (optional, I never use it myself as it's too overpowering)</li>
<li>Lemon wedge/juice (optional, also overpowering)</li>
<li>Rice (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cook some rice and set aside. White short-grain is best but other types will do as long as it's not starchy. Don't use arborio or sushi rice.</li>
<li>Prepare the stock, possibly the day before, by boiling fish and fish bones in a tall stock pot on medium heat for 1-2 hours. It's customary to have loose chunks of fish in the soup so you can boil the fish and separate the meat as it starts to cook. As an example, the head, tail, skin and spine from the <a href=\"/fried-anglerfish-fillet\">anglerfish fillet recipe</a> were used to make stock, then half a fillet and meat that separated from the offal became part of the soup.</li>
<li>In a pot, heat some oil on low heat and add in the onions. Saute until translucent.</li>
<li>Add the garlic, tomato, herbs and salt if desired. Switch to medium heat, stirring occasionally until the water starts to boil.</li>
<li>Add the fish and let simmer on low heat until the fish are cooked thoroughly, being careful not to break them. Turn the heat off and add the olive oil.</li>
<li>Take the fish out to be served separately. They are traditionally served topped with olive oil and a squeeze of lemon with steamed vegetables.</li>
<li>If you are using lemon juice or rice, add them to each serving according to your preference.</li>
<li>Leave some for tomorrow. It always tastes better the next day.</li>

UPDATE recipe:28l0x14qwvlo7l0mevog CONTENT { author: 'N/A', date: '2021-03-21', html: '<p>If you love spicy foods and chicken then this Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich recipe is just for you. It takes some time with prepping and process but when you take that first bite all the effort will be worth it. It‚Äôs unlike any other fried chicken recipe that includes double frying your chicken and using the same cooking oil from your fry as a sauce for the Nashville Hot Chicken spice.</p>
<p>Nashville Hot Chicken was invented by a man named Thorton Prince. It is said that he came home late one night and whipped this dish up randomly. Could you imagine creating this staple of a dish late night after coming home from an evening of festivities, blows my mind. Let‚Äôs get into the recipe now.</p>
<ul>
<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 20 min</li>
<li>üç≥ Cook time: 30 min</li>
<li>üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Batter</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Cups Buttermilk</li>
<li>1/3 Cup Hot sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Flour</p>
<ul>
<li>2 1/2 Cups All-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 tbsp Cornstarch</li>
<li>3 tbsp Seasoned salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp Paprika</li>
<li>2 tsp Cayenne pepper</li>
<li>2 tsp Black pepper</li>
<li>1 tbsp Garlic powder</li>
<li>1 tbsp Onion powder</li>
<li>2 tsp Dry mustard powder</li>
</ul>
<p>Nashville Hot Chicken</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp Nashville Hot Chicken seasoning</li>
<li>2 tbsp Adobo honey seasoning</li>
<li>2 tbsp Dark brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp Chili powder</li>
<li>1 tsp Garlic powder</li>
<li>1 tsp Smoked paprika</li>
<li>1 1/2 Cups Cooking oil Used to fry the chicken</li>
</ul>
<p>Sauce For the Buns</p>
<ul>
<li>3 tbsp Mayo</li>
<li>1 tbsp Ketchup</li>
<li>2 tbsp Sweet relish</li>
<li>1 tbsp Hot sauce</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Prep your chicken by trimming it into less than a 1/2&quot; patties for frying.</li>
<li>Prepare your batter and flour in two separate bowls.</li>
<li>Dunk your chicken into the flour, then batter and then flour again. While your chicken is sitting with the battered flour pour 2 1/2 cups of cooking oil into your pan over medium heat or 350 degrees. Let it come to temp, about 20 mins.</li>
<li>Once your oil has reached the temp of 350, go ahead and fry 3-4 pieces of chicken at one time. You are going to fry for 7 mins (flipping at the midway point) and then pull the chicken and let sit for 5 mins then refry for the second time 3 mins, this depends on the thickness of the chicken.</li>
<li>Now that your chicken is fried make sure you have a wire rack with a sheet pan under it so the crispy chicken can sit and rest on. During this resting time, you are going to add your Nashville Hot Chicken seasoning together with 1 1/2 cups of the cooking oil you just used. It will simmer but quickly whisk until it comes still. Now you want to brush that amazing sauce all over the crispy chicken or dunk it.</li>
<li>Have some toasted buns ready and create your sandwich. First, you want to sauce your top and bottom buns, add shredded romaine lettuce, chicken patty, tomato and then complete with the top bun for an amazingly delicious creation.</li>
<li>Feed the family and enjoy! This one gets spicy, &gt;E  N  J  O Y&lt; :)</li>

<li>üç≥ Cook time: 11 min</li>
<li>üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 1~2, about 1 plate full</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Russet Potato, or other potato with high starch and low moisture. The amount of starch effects the crunchiness of the chip.</li>
<li>Peanut Oil for frying (at least 1 to 2 inches in the pan)</li>
<li>Salt or seasoning of your choice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Set a wok or pot over medium-low heat and add the peanut oil about 1 to 2 inches up the pot. Set a thermometer to monitor the temperature to reach 315 F (157 C).</li>
<li>Wash the exterior of the potato. Using a mandolin set on 2 mm (~1/16th inch), a very sharp knife or a potato peeler cut the potatoes into thin chip slices.</li>
<li>Add the potatoes to the hot oil and cook for 9 to 11 minutes while stirring fairly constantly. &lt;br&gt;
Note: The oil should drop to roughly 250 F in the first few minutes before stabilizing and increasing back to 315 F. This may be slightly different depending on the size of the pot and the amount of oil you use.</li>
<li>Once golden browned and completely crisp with no bubbling, remove the chips with a slotted spoon and add to a paper towel over a wire rack to absorb excess oil. Seasoning immediately with salt and any seasoning of your choice.</li>
<li>Don't throw away your oil! Let it cool. Place a paper towel in a metal strainer and strain it into a glass or plastic container for next time.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Seasoning suggestion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ethan suggests making a special seasoning from jalape√±os, onions, garlic, salt and (optional) some MSG. This optional step takes a LOT longer than the rest of the recipe.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Dry out the vegetables after cutting and preparing them, sliced quite thin so that they dry out, in the oven at the lowest temperature that it will go to.</li>
<li>Leave for about 6 hours to dry in the oven.</li>
<li>Once dry and brittle, break the vegetables up into little pieces.</li>
<li>Powder them in a mortar and pestle until completely dry and fine.</li>
<li>Pour powder into a separate bowl.</li>
<li>Add a spoonfull of salt and (optional) a small amount of MSG to the mortar and pestle. Grind to the same consistency as the vegetables.</li>
<li>Add the salt-msg mix to the vegetable powder along with about half a tablespoon of sugar</li>
<li>Sprinkle over the chips and mix well.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<li>Chop the potato(es) on your cutting board with a sharp knife throwing them onto the pan.</li>

<li>A fast method to cut the the sweet pototoes is first into fourths, slice the fourths, chops the sliced layers while stacked into fries.</li>
<li>If you want to experiment with a variety of fats, consider combining the olive oil with grass-fed butter and coconut oil. I believe the issue with coconut oil is it likes being cooked at lower temperatures or else the health quality of the oil will degrade.</li>

<li>A vanilla bean, or essence (Optional)</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat all ingredients in a pan (with the marbles, if you want,) on a medium-heat stove, constantly mixing with a wooden spoon.</li>
<li>Once the sugar dissolves, set heat to very low, and keep mixing once in a while for approximately two hours. It should not boil, if it happens, set it aside, keep mixing and once the temperature lowers put it back on the heat.</li>
<li>Once the preparation gets thicker, be more careful and mix it more frequently so that it does not stick (and burn)
and lumps do not form.</li>
<li>Once you get a consistency similar to that of a custard, set it aside and keep mixing for 10 minutes, until it gets
cold and thickens a bit more. If you put a spoon inside, pass your finger in the middle and it does not unite anymore, it is done.</li>

<li>~150g (1/3 lb) medium soft cheese. Appenzeller works best. Gruy√®re would be my go-to alternative.</li>
<li>a jar of apple sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to vary these amounts, it's not like this is anything strict.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fry bacon cubes in pot (this pot will be used for everything so choose an appropriately large one).</li>
<li>Cut onions into half-rings and let them sweat in the same pot. Add some butter if your bacon was not fatty enough.</li>
<li>Peel potatoes and cut them into ~1 cm/half inch cubes.</li>
<li>When the onions have become sufficiently cooked, add potatoes.</li>
<li>Top everything with milk and let the potatoes cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Add macaroni and the remaining milk to cover everything. Most of the milk will be absorbed by the macaroni.</li>
<li>Shred your cheese.</li>
<li>A minute or two before the macaroni are done, add the shredded cheese into the pot. It should appear a bit too runny in the pot. While cooling it will increase in viscosity quite a bit. If the final texture is not creamy enough, it is most likely due to using the wrong cheese.</li>
<li>Season to taste. (Needs quite a bit of salt). Nutmeg also works well here.</li>
<li>Serve with apple sauce. Should be eaten together, not as a dessert.</li>

<p>Mashed potatoes is a really great recipe that is often relegated to the position
of side dish. This recipe is a spin of the classical mashed potatoes recipe
that's got itself more going on. You can serve this dish for a relatively light
meal, or you can also serve it as a side dish if you want to have a really
hearty meal.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>The quantities here are for about four adult portions. If you are planning on
eating this as a side dish, it might be more like 6-8 portions.</p>
<ul>
<li>1kg potatoes</li>
<li>200ml milk*</li>
<li>200ml mayonnaise*</li>
<li>~100g cheese</li>
<li>Garlic powder</li>
<li>12-16 strips of bacon</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>3-4 green onions</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p>*You can play with the proportions depending on how creamy or dry you want the
mashed potatoes to be.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Peel and cut the potatoes into medium sized pieces.</li>
<li>Put the potatoes in a pot with some water so that it covers the potatoes and
boil them for about 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.</li>
<li>About ten minutes before removing the potatoes from the boiling water, cut
the bacon into little pieces and fry it.</li>
<li>Warm up the milk and mayonnaise.</li>
<li>Shred the cheese.</li>
<li>When the potatoes are done, remove all water from the pot, add the warm milk
and mayonnaise mix, add some butter, and mash with a potato masher or a
blender.</li>
<li>Add some salt, black pepper and garlic powder to taste and continue mashing
the mix.</li>
<li>Once the mix is somewhat homogeneous and the potatoes are properly mashed,
add the shredded cheese and fried bacon and mix a little.</li>
<li>Serve and top with chopped green onions.</li>

<h3>Dough</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>400 g 00 flour</li>
<li>Drizzle of olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 lemon</li>
<li>50 g grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
<li>250 g ricotta</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
</ul>
<h3>Seafood Fillings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chopped leftover lobster legs, lobster tail, or minced crab (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>The basic rule of thumb I use for pasta is 100g, 1 egg per person</li>
<li>For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school &quot;well&quot; method or a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7)</li>
<li>For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your hand carve a hole or a well in the center</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of olive oil into the center</li>
<li>With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can escape the outer well border</li>
<li>At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth</li>
<li>For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and it will be done</li>
<li>You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the dough a bit longer after it's done to make it into a nice smooth ball</li>
<li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a bit so it's easier to roll out (15-30 mins)</li>
<li>While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the  ricotta and egg into a bowl</li>
<li>Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl</li>
<li>Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point</li>
<li>Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly</li>
<li>Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not currently being worked on covered so they don't dry out</li>
<li>Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or so</li>
<li>At this point you can either cut the sheet in half and make two sheets, a top and bottom, or one sheet, where you will fold the dough over and use the folded seam as one side of the ravioli
<img src=\"/pix/ravioli-02.webp\" alt=\"Lobster Ravioli\" /></li>
<li>Using a teaspoon, evenly space out the ricotta filling onto the sheets, leaving a few inches on each side for the seams</li>
<li>As stated in step 16, either take the 2nd sheet and place it over top or fold over the dough and press down firmly, forcing out any air and making sure the two pieces of dough stick</li>
<li>You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily floured and not sticking</li>
<li>Using a fancy pasta cutter, a knife, or even a pizza cutter, cut evenly between the seams of the raviolis to separate them</li>
<li>If you used a pasta cutter, you are now done, store the raviolis on a floured wax paper sheet or freeze them for later
<img src=\"/pix/ravioli-03.webp\" alt=\"Finished Ravioli\" /></li>
<li>If you don't have a pasta cutter, use a fork to press down the dough around the edges of the cut raviolis to ensure they are firmly closed and no leaks or air bubbles are visible, or else they will explode when cooked</li>
<li>To cook, throw them in salted boiling water and they will let you know when they're done when they float to the top (1-2 minutes)</li>
<li>Serve the seafood version with a simple fresh red sauce and basil, or spice it up a bit and go with a base of red sauce with some added heavy cream, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to make a pink sauce for the seafood version

I made them what I call &quot;Hangover Eggs&quot;. Whetheror not you're hungover, they're very delicious! I've recently been making them to gain weight, though you can alter the recipe to whatever
suits your lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tony Chachere's</li>
<li>Green onions</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Loaf of French Bread</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Tabasco</li>
<li>Beer</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Bring a cast iron pan to medium-high heat and add a second or two of olive oil when things start to warm up.</li>
<li>While the pan heats up, use your hands and tear off pieces of bread that are roughly the size of your hand.</li>
<li>Make sure you have one piece of bread per egg you want to make. I've dabbled with the egg:bread ratios, and this seems to work.</li>
<li>Once the olive oil starts smelling a bit (or smoke comes off of it), crack in however many eggs you care to eat. Turn down the heat to medium.</li>
<li>Act fast! As the eggs start cooking, prepare a plate with two handfuls of chopped green onion and Tabasco.</li>
<li>After about four minutes (or when the tops of the eggs start to set), take out eggs and place on top of bed of onions &amp; Tabasco.</li>
<li>Turn heat back to medium-high and add a touch more olive oil. Place pieces of bread in pan.</li>
<li>Every so often, move the pieces of bread around to soak up the oil.</li>
<li>When the bread is about to turn a good shade of golden-brown, add a generous sprinkle of Tony Chachere's to the plated eggs (on top of them).</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and move the pan off the burner. Take out bread pieces and place on the same plate as the eggs.</li>
<li>Serve with glass of ice-cold beer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, you won't even need a fork! Simply use the bread to guide the eggs on top of each piece, break the yolk into the piece, and take a large
bite.</p>

<li>1 Lime (to taste)</li>
<li>Fish/Oyster Sauce</li>
<li>Honey or Brown Sugar</li>
<li>Rice noodles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat your oven and place the spices (garlic, cardamom seeds, cinnamon sticks, star anise and ginger) on a tray and bake them until browned or decently toasted.</li>
<li>Boil bones until you remove most of the scum, and transfer the spices from the oven into the pot. Life will be easier if you can place the spices in a tea strainer of sorts, otherwise, it's not the worst thing in the world fishing them out later on.</li>
<li>Add beef bouillon cubes, diced beef, fish/oyster sauce, and honey/sugar, then simmer for a couple hours with the lid on.</li>
<li>Cook the rice noodles (should only take a few minutes, just until the texture is al dente enough).</li>
<li>Once the broth is done cooking, fish out the spices that you added at step 2. It's worth doing this rather than accidentally chewing on a bit of star anise, trust me.</li>
<li>Cut up coriander and spring onions as garnish.</li>
<li>Add rice noodles to bowl, followed by the broth and its contents, followed by the garnish. This can be made and eaten within 1 hour if you want it quickly, but typically with broths the longer you simmer the tastier it'll be.</li>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>There is some controversy over when to add the pasta sauce to this dish.
Some place it on the chicken before cooking it with the mozzarella.
The sauce, if left on the chicken too long will make the breadcrumbs go soggy.
That also will make leftovers mushy (while still tasty).
I recommend keeping the breasts separate and only adding the sauce when served.</p>

<p>Nothing beats meat, cheese and tomato combined together to create the best
combination of flavors that man has created.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>The quantities here are for about two adult portions. That is, if you are also
making some side dish, like in the photo.</p>
<p>For the meatballs:</p>
<ul>
<li>300-400g of ground beef meat</li>
<li>1/4 of an onion</li>
<li>~70g of cheese; I have made with different cheese types, but usually I use
Gouda</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
<li>1-2 garlic cloves</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>~1/5 metric cups (~50ml) of bread crumbs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sauce:</p>
<ul>
<li>250ml of water</li>
<li>8 spoonfuls of tomato paste</li>
<li>Oregano</li>
<li>Basil</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Beat the egg(s) in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Add in the ground beef, and the bread crumbs and mix.</li>
<li>Chop the onion into small pieces and add it to the bowl.</li>
<li>Mince the garlic cloves and add to the bowl.</li>
<li>Dice the parsley leaves and add to the bowl.</li>
<li>Salt the beef mix and mix it thoroughly.</li>
<li>Cut the cheese into cubes. The amount of cubes you will need will depend on
how many meatballs you make, which depends on how big you want to make the
meatballs. You get the idea.</li>
<li>Take a cheese cube and wrap with enough ground meat to completely cover it.
Repeat this process until you've run out of the ground beef mix.</li>
<li>Heat the frying pan, add some olive oil, and add the meatballs. Cook over
medium heat rolling the meatballs from time to time until they are slightly
brown from all sides (wait, spheres have no sides).</li>
<li>When the meatballs look done, pour the water and tomato paste; add the dried
oregano and basil, and ground black pepper; and salt to taste.</li>
<li>Cook over medium-low heat for about ten minutes rolling the meatballs so
that they get completely bathed in tomato sauce.</li>
<li>Serve with some side dish and enjoy!</li>

a brownish red. Mix with your spatula, and let fry for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Open the can of beans and pour the beans into the pan. Depending on how
liquid you want the refried beans to be, you can use all or just some part of
the liquid inside the can. I usually get rid of some of the liquid from the
can before pouring the beans.</li>
<li>Mash the beans and mix. Let them fry at medium-low to medium heat for about 5
to 10 minutes, mixing from time to time.</li>

<ul>
<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 15-30 min</li>
<li>üç≥ Cook time: 25-30 min</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Serves Around 3 People. You can scale up to 4 If you increase most quantities by +1/4.</p>
<ul>
<li>Medium Sweet Onion (Finely Chopped)</li>
<li>Virgin olive oil (not extra-virgin)</li>
<li>White Sugar</li>
<li>3 Fresh Medium Garlic Cloves (Chopped Fine)</li>
<li>15-20 Kalamon/Kalamata Olives (Cut into thirds)</li>
<li>Whole small courgette (Cut to small pieces)</li>
<li>6 Medium Mushrooms (Cut smallish and small stalk)</li>
<li>1/2 Broccli (Chopped small)</li>
<li>8-10 Finely sliced cherry tomatoes</li>
<li>1/2 Block of feta (Washed)</li>
<li>1 Chicken stock (Added to 3/4 Mug boiling water)</li>
<li>Overfilled Teaspoon Mixed Spice</li>
<li>3/4 Bowls fusilli pasta</li>
<li>Overfilled tablespoon Creme Cheese</li>
<li>1/3 Mug whole milk</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Make sure to prepare &amp; chop most ingredients before you start.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a small deepish pan and heat it to low-medium temperature. Add a good amount of virgin olive oil and place one of the small onion pieces into the pan. Wait until it starts to sizzle and add the rest of the onion. Mix well and make sure the temperature is not too high as it can damage ingredients. Optional: You can sprinkle some sugar over the onion to make it sweeter. Then after a few minutes, when the onion has browned/softened, add in the garlic and wait 1-2 minutes, then you can turn off heat and put it to the side for later.</li>
<li>Get a medium-large sized deepish pan, heat with oil and then add in the olives, courgettes and mushrooms. Sprinkle salt every now and then to enhance taste. After a few minutes when they are soft and are around the same color, then add in the onion and garlic from the smaller pan.</li>
<li>Wait a couple minutes and then add the broccoli and tomato slices to the mix. Wait 2-3 more minutes and then get your rinsed feta and melt it in the pan (chop to speed up).</li>
<li>Start <a href="/pasta">cooking the pasta</a>.</li>
<li>When the feta has nearly finished melting, add in the stock to the mix. Turn the pan temperature down slightly and then let it bubble for 5 mins (add a timer). Make sure to add the cover to the pan to keep in the flavor.</li>
<li>After the 5 mins timer is up, add the overfilled tablespoon creme cheese to the main mix, stir, then re-add lid.</li>
<li>Wait 2-3 more minutes and then you can test the sauce if you want. If you feel there is some missing, add more mixed spice or herbs such as parsley to it.</li>
<li>Turn down the main mix again slightly and add the 1/3 Mug of Whole milk to the mix.</li>
<li>Strain and serve your pasta and cover with the sauce. Enjoy!</li>

<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep Time: 10 min</li>
<li>üç≥Cook Time: 2 hours</li>
<li>üçΩÔ∏èServings: 4</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1lb of <strong>Fillet</strong> Beef</li>
<li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>1lb of mushrooms</li>
<li>4 Thinly Cut Slices of Ham</li>
<li>2tbsp of Yellow Mustard</li>
<li>7oz of Puff Pastry</li>
<li>2 Egg Yolks Beaten</li>
</ul>
<p>Side note: Fillet beef is preferred.  It gives the beef wellington a soft, tender and juicy flavour.  Trust me, using fillet is worth it.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Season the fillet with salt and black pepper.</li>
<li>With a nicely-oiled pan on high heat, sear the fillet on all sides, including the ends.  For the standard medium-rare beef wellington, do not cook the fillet, just sear it, tough if you want something more cooked than medium-rare, it's wise to give it more heat here.  Put it aside on a plate.</li>
<li>Brush the fillet with yellow mustard <em>immediatly</em> after taking it out of the pan.  This allows the musturd's flavour to be absorbed by the fillet and thus preserve a mildly hot flavor.</li>
<li>Chop the mushrooms. Put them in a food processor. Transfer the pur√©e to a saut√© pan that has been heated to medium high heat to cook. Allow the mushrooms to release their moisture; once the moisture has been boiled away take the mushrooms out of pan to cool.</li>
<li>Lay out the slices of ham on plastic wrap and spread the mushroom mixture over the ham.  Place the fillet in the middle.  Wrap the fillet into a tight barrel shape twist the end of the plastic wrap to secure the wrap and the refrigerate the whole thing for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 302¬∞F/150¬∞C.</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out a sheet of puff pastry to a size that will fit the fillet.  Preserve a little excess pastry. Unwrap the fillet-mushroom-ham from the plastic wrap and place in the middle of the pastry dough.  Brush the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg yolks.</li>
<li>Place the pastry-wrapped thing on a baking tray. Brush the exposed surface again with the beaten eggs. Optionally, score the top of the pastry with a knife, to give it a better presentation.  Scratch the surface of it but don't cut it through.  Season it through with coarse salt.</li>
<li>Bake at 302¬∞F/105¬∞C for 35-42 minutes. The pastry should be nicely golden when done.  Let it rest for about 10 minutes and cut it into 1in/2.54cm-thick slices for presentation.</li>

<h3>How long should pasta be cooked?</h3>
<p>The often recommended way to cook most pasta is <em>al dente</em>, which often means &quot;slightly undercooked,&quot; or with a subtle firmness that makes it still substantial.
Cooking pasta more than that is no great crime,
but if you keep it in there for <em>too</em> long, it'll become mush.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Anglerfish</li>
<li>Butter, enough to fry with</li>
<li>Chives or green onions</li>
<li>Marjoram, fresh herbs are preferable</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<h3>Preparing the fish</h3>
<ol>
<li>Turn the creature on its back. With a sharp and preferably short-bladed knife make an incision from the anus to just between the two small fins under the head. This is best done by inserting the knife blade tip facing up while putting force upwards and moving towards the head, letting gravity do the work. This helps to avoid puncturing the organs.</li>
<li>Remove the organs. Gently pull and cut the membrane that connects each to the rest of the body.</li>
<li>Make an incision around the mouth (the hard 'lips'), turn the fish around and do the same to that side.</li>
<li>Start to slowly but firmly pull back the skin cutting whenever there is resistance as you make your way towards the tail.</li>
<li>Once you have removed the skin, flip it back onto its back and cut off the thin flabs of meat of its underside and fins from the body. At this point there should be a clear distinction between the body and the larger head. Behead the animal.</li>
<li>With a filleting knife, fillet the meat from the backbone and remove the tail.</li>
<li>You should be left with 2 long strips of meat. Cut each in half.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<ol start=\"8\">
<li>In a pan on medium heat, melt a good amount of butter and place the fillets inside. The goal here is to sear the meat to get that light crust. Flip until all sides have turned the 'golden brown' color.</li>
<li>Add the herbs, just enough to cover the fillets, salt and pepper too if desired and cover with the lid on low heat until fully cooked. Time here varies but it can be anywhere between 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Enjoy. This goes well with steamed vegetables. Or potatoes to soak up the butter.</li>

<p>Carbonara is a simple dish. The quality of your ingredients makes or breaks it.
I recommend using the best ingredients you can source.
Suggestions: bronze extruded pasta, 24 months aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, 12+ months aged Pecorino Romano, guanciale from the butcher, and organic eggs.</p>
<p>This recipe assumes medium eggs.</p>

<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 5 min</li>
<li>üç≥ Cook time: 25 min</li>
<li>üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spaghetti: 320 g | 11 oz</li>
<li>Eggs: 5</li>
<li>Guanciale or Smoked Pancetta (cleaned and cubed): 150 g | 5 oz</li>
<li>Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano (grated)(optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Crack the eggs in a bowl but only add the yolks. Add a generous amount of your preferred grated cheese (Pecorino or Parmigiano) around 35g (you can optionally add a dash of black pepper).</li>
<li>Fill a pot with water and salt it less than typical <a href=\"/pasta\">pasta</a> water. When it boils, cook the pasta one minute less than advised.</li>
<li>Fry the preferred pork (Guanciale or Smoked Pancetta) in an iron or nonstick pan (if using a different kind of pan add a dash of extra virgin olive oil) on low to medium heat until the sides are crisp but the insides are chewy.</li>
<li>While everything is being cooked and fried, beat the eggs manually using a fork until everything is entirely liquid. Remember to watch the time.</li>
<li>When your pasta is done (-1 minute), drain it and put it in the bowl with eggs. At this step you may consider the timing: if the pasta is too hot you will cook the eggs, and some people don't like it this way, so just wait for a minute. Keep moving and stirring to fully incorporate the eggs. Add guanciale and as many fats remaining in the pan as you want. Keep moving and stirring.</li>
<li>Plate and optionally garnish with the preferred grated cheese and black pepper. Voila.</li>

<li><strong>Important</strong>. Once you no longer hear pops for about 3 seconds, immediately transfer into a bowl to avoid burning.</li>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Pour the milk and the salt into a pot, stir it well, and heat it up to 35¬∞C.
Once the temperature has been reached, add the rennet and stir well.
Let it cook until it solidifies (about 1 and a half hours), then cut in 1x1cm squares.
Let it rest for half an hour.
Pour the cheese into the cheesecloth and il drip until it has completely separated from the liquid part (whey).
Place the cheese into the recipient.
Cover both sides of the cheese with coarse salt, repeat this operation twice, waiting 1 hour between two saltings.

<h3>Aging (optional)</h3>
<p>Store the cheese in a chill place (around 12¬∞C).
Every day of aging, flip the cheese upside-down.
For the first two weeks, also cover it with oil and vinegar every day.</p>

<p>If they like acids, you can feed it to your plants: it's pretty much giving them water and fertilizer in one go, you can feed it to your animals, since it's a great source of proteins, it's the prime ingredient of another cheese called &quot;Ricotta&quot;, it can be used instead of water in sever recipes, and many other: you can even drink it.

<li>One can of garbanzo beans (chickpeas)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 cup of tahini (also known as tehina)</li>
<li>1/4 cup (or more, to taste) of lemon juice, fresh preferred - this is about 1 1/2 to 2 lemons' worth</li>
<li>1 (or 2) clove(s) of garlic, roughly chopped (fresh or frozen pre-chopped is fine, but not dry)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon cumin, ground (if you have whole, toast in a dry pan until fragrant before grinding)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon za'atar (optional, if you can find it)</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon of olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
<li>Fresh parsley (optional for serving)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Drain and rinse the garbanzo beans.</li>
<li>Place garbanzo beans in a small saucepan or pot, add 1 teaspoon baking soda (this alters the pH to encourage the beans to break down and shed their skins), and cover with a few inches of water. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes, until the skins begin to fall off and the beans look overcooked/mushy. You may need to reduce the heat after a few minutes to prevent boil-overs.</li>
<li>While the garbanzo beans are boiling, combine the garlic and lemon juice with 1/4 teaspoon salt in the workbowl of your food processor. Pulse until a fine, uniform consistency is achieved. You may need to scrape down the top and sides of the bowl to ensure the garlic is chopped finely enough. Leave the mixture for at least 10 minutes for the raw garlic taste to mellow.</li>
<li>After 20 minutes of boiling, drain the garbanzo beans and their skins in a mesh strainer, then rinse for at least 30 seconds with cold water to remove any lingering taste from the baking soda.</li>
<li>Add the tahini to the food processor. Blend until creamy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.</li>
<li>While the food processor is running on &quot;high,&quot; slowly drizzle in two tablespoons of ice-cold water. Continue to run on high, scraping down the bowl as necessary (1-3 times), until the mixture has enough air worked into it that it lightens in color and thickens in texture substantially.</li>
<li>Scrape down the bowl again, then add the garbanzo beans and cumin (and za'atar, if you have it). Pulse a few times, then set the food processor to high again. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, as slowly as you can manage.</li>
<li>Continue to process the hummus on high for at least one minute longer, up to three minutes longer if it hasn't become smooth enough yet. You can make the hummus thinner at this point by slowly adding ice water a teaspoon at a time while processing on high. Taste the hummus at this point to determine if it needs more lemon juice or more salt for flavor.</li>
<li>Transfer the hummus into a serving bowl and smooth out the surface with the back of a spoon, creating swirls or indentations for olive oil as desired. Top with additional olive oil and optionally finely chopped fresh parsley, more za'atar, or a sprinkling of sumac (a spice mixture) or dukkah (a seed mixture).</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Primary brew:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boil 1-2l of water.</li>
<li>Rinse all the dishes you will be working with boiling water; this is
important so the brew doesn't go bad while fermenting.</li>
<li>Steep 3-5 tbsp (or 5-6 bags) of tee in 3-5 cups of water.</li>
<li>Strain the leaves from the tea and add 2 cups of sugar (or honey).</li>
<li>Add other optional teas to your liking; I like to add a good handful of
rosella tea; steep and strain this in boiling water separately.</li>
<li>Add 4l of water to the tea concentrate and pour into a wide mouthed jar.</li>
<li>Let the tea sit until it is less than 40¬∞C; add ice cubes if it has to go
quick.</li>
<li>Add your scoby to the jar and seal the mouth tightly with a cloth or paper
towel and a rubber band. The scoby has to breathe, but you want to prevent
insects and dirt from getting into the jar.</li>
<li>Let the jar sit in a warm dark spot for 10-14 days.</li>
</ol>
<p>Second brew:</p>
<ol>
<li>Taste the brew after 10-14 days; if it has started to carbonate and the
sugar is mostly gone, it is ready. The brewing time will strongly depend on
your personal preference, shorten or lengthen as you wish.</li>
<li>Once ready, strain 4/5 of the brew through a sieve into re-sealable glass
bottles.</li>
<li>Make another batch of primary brew and refill the big jar; the remaining old
brew will act as a starter. Rinse the jar and remove parts of the scoby once
in a while.</li>
<li>If you wish you can add juices, fruits, or spices to your brew. These will
partially ferment and add a special character to your kombucha. One nice
addition is apple and cinnamon mixed in with green tea.</li>
<li>Let the bottles sit in a warm dark spot for another 3-14 days; the
carbonation process will continue, so make sure to release pressure from the
bottles every other day.</li>
<li>When you are satisfied with the carbonation and the flavor, put the bottles
in the fridge. Here you can store them for weeks at a time.</li>
<li>Enjoy your kombucha, rinse, and repeat.</li>

<p>If you are feeling quite hungry after just waking up and want to have a
breakfast to fill your HP and stamina bars for the day, I've got just the
perfect recipe for you.</p>
<p>To be honest, this is more of a build-your-own dish. What I am providing here, I
would say, is more of a starting point and you're more than welcome to add (or
remove) anything you'd like. I also have to say that this is not exclusively a
breakfast dish, I've had it for breakfast, for lunch, for supper, for dinner,
etc. Although, I guess when you're a student just any food at any time of the
day will do.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Since I more often than not cook this only for myself, the ingredient list below
is calculated for one person. Once more, this is not a strict ingredient list,
so you can really add anything you want. I would say that the only ingredients
that are a most are the eggs and the potatoes. The rest of the ingredients I
will mark with * for the ones that I usually use, and ** for ingredients that I
have used, but seldom use.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>2 small/medium-sized potatoes</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
<li>4-6 bacon strips*</li>
<li>¬Ω an onion*</li>
<li>Cheese (I usually use Gouda)*</li>
<li>Paprika*</li>
<li>A couple of Champignon 'shrooms**</li>
<li>Some slices of bell pepper**</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut the bacon into pieces and fry it on a pan.</li>
<li>Cut the potatoes into small cubes.</li>
<li>After frying the bacon, set aside and use the bacon grease to fry the
potatoes over medium/medium-low heat for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Add some salt and paprika to the potatoes, mix well and cook for another ten
minutes.</li>
<li>Cut the onions and add them to the frying pan. Cook for about five minutes.</li>
<li>If you decide to add some vegetables, like mushrooms or peppers, add them
now.</li>
<li>Now, there are two ways you can cook the eggs.*
<ul>
<li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and the pour them onto the pan.</li>
<li>Or just crack the eggs directly on the mix in the pan and mix everything
thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cut the cheese into small slices and add it.</li>
<li>Cook for a couple of minutes more, until eggs are cooked enough. Don't let
the eggs dry (unless that's the way you like your eggs ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø).</li>
<li>For the final touch, chop the parsley (or whatever other spices/herbs you
decided to use) and add it on top.</li>
<li>Serve hot and add some freshly ground pepper.</li>
</ol>
<p>*Personally, I prefer to beat the eggs first in a bowl before adding them to the
frying pan.</p>

<p>This is a recipe for a basic loaf of bread. The dough itself can be used however. I've made buns, rolls, and whole bread loafs using this same exact dough every time without a problem. Eat within 3 days as it will probably be going stale around then (as bread without preservatives and other junk should).</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
<li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons Active Dry Yeast</li>
<li>1 Tsp sugar</li>
<li>2 Tbsp  maple syrup, agave, or honey</li>
<li>1/2 Tbsp salt</li>
<li>3 3/4 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour (plus more for rolling / dusting)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Proof the yeast. To do this warm 1/4 cup water to about bath water heat (110 degrees F, 43 degrees C) add active dry yeast and 1 Tsp sugar. Let sit for about 10 minutes, mixture should at least be doubled in size after waiting.</li>
<li>Combine rest of water, yeast mixture, maple syrup (or other sweetener), salt, and flour in a large mixing bowl and stir. The result will be a sticky, rough dough. Use a spoon to stir until well combined and when it can no longer do the job, knead and turn it in the bowl with your hands.</li>
<li>Lift the dough out and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover and let rise for 2 hours at room temperature.</li>
<li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until dough is elastic. Rule of thumb is 10 minutes of kneading.</li>
<li>Place seam-side down in a lightly greased loaf pan or baking sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 45-60 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C)* toward the end of the dough resting time and place a metal pan (NOT glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack. Also have 1 cup of hot water ready.</li>
<li>When the oven is preheated, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut about ¬Ω-inch deep.</li>
<li>Place in oven on middle rack. Then carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Expect it to bubble and steam; then close oven door quickly.</li>
<li>Bake the bread for 26 to 35 minutes, or until deep golden brown and risen. Tapping the top of the loaf should produce a hollow sound.</li>
<li>Remove the bread from the oven and let rest in the pan for 5 minutes. Then carefully remove from pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool. Let it cool completely before slicing for best results (otherwise it can be doughy in the middle).</li>
<li>Store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to a few days. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instant yeast is not recommended as you can't easily tell if the bread will come to life.</li>
<li>For whole wheat version use 2 cups of whole wheat bread and 1 and 3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour.</li>
<li>Add sunflower seeds and/or rolled oats for extra flavor/grains.</li>
<li>For buns or rolls divide dough into smaller pieces before second rest. Shape them and then let the dough rest. Recommended lowering oven temperature to 350 F and not using water as those will result in a hard crust and potentially dry interior.</li>

<li>3 Eggs, beaten</li>
<li>1 tsp Salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>1 cup Flour</li>
<li>1 - 2/3 cups Milk</li>
<li>6-8 tbsp Butter</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>At medium/low heat begin melting the butter, and continue with beating eggs in large bowl, add salt, sugar, milk, flour and mix.</li>
<li>Add melted butter while stirring batter.</li>
<li>Use about 1/2 cup batter on griddle and tilt until spread evenly over griddle surface.</li>
<li>When edges of pancake start to firm-up use spatula and free up the outside inch or two to achieve a clean removal for flipping later.</li>
<li>First side will take about a minute or more the second side will take half that time. Pick up at middle of pancake with spatula then place on plate and fold over. The pancake will then be four layers thick 10&quot; x 2&quot; long. Serve with syrup on top or anything you choose, my wife likes peanut butter and I prefer to spread a little butter on it before adding syrup. Maybe you prefer adding fruits of your choice.</li>

<ul>
<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30 min</li>
<li>üç≥ Cook time: 6 hours</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>7 pears (Quality doesn't matter; you can argue that overripe pears are better because they have more sugar content.)</li>
<li>3 apples</li>
<li>a small handful of dates, raisins, dried apricots or prunes (optional -- you can experiment with these; they can bring out some nice flavors.)</li>
<li>150 grams sugar</li>
<li>1 glass of water</li>
<li>find sieve or cheese cloth</li>
<li>glass jar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wash the outside of the fruit with water and cut it in 8 medium sized pieces. You don't have to core or deseed the fruit; everything can go in the pot.</li>
<li>Place the fruit in a large pan with a thick bottom so you get even heat. I suggest you place the pears on the bottom, since they don't burn as fast. Add the glass of water.</li>
<li>If you are using them, add the dried fruits at this point.</li>
<li>Put the heat as low as possible and let it all slowly stew for 3 hours, stirring every now and then.</li>
<li>At this point, you can boil your glass jars to sterilize them. Place the sterilized jars on a clean, dry towel.</li>
<li>When the fruit is done cooking for 3 hours, grab your sieve or cheese cloth, and place it over a bowl, run your fruit through it until you have extracted all the clear liquid. You can discard the pulp.</li>
<li>Quickly rinse the pot with water until clean and add the fruit liquid back. Place back on the stove.</li>
<li>Add the sugar. Add a bit less sugar if you also used dried fruits.</li>
<li>Cook for another 2 hours. After that, stir every so often, Be careful with the stirring; if you stir too often, it might caramelize too quickly.</li>
<li>After two to two and a half hours, your syrup should be nearly done.</li>
<li>At this point, it's up to you on how thick you want your syrup to be. A good way to test the viscosity is to drop a little bit on a cold plate or on your countertop to see how it is at room temperature.</li>
<li>When you are happy with the viscosity, pour the syrup into your sterilized jars and immediately seal them.</li>

<p>This is a recipe for a typical Austrian carb and protein bomber. This is traditionally made with ham or smoked rolled roast. This is good if you want to feed a family or if you just want to be lazy and eat the same thing for 3 or 4 days.</p>
<p>Serve topped with cheese on top of salad (with Mustard, Jam, Salt, 1 Vinegar, 4 Oil-Vinegrette)</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1kg ham or smoked rolled roast</li>
<li>1kg cooked fusilli noodles or small square flat noodles (=Fleckerl)</li>
<li>500 ml cream</li>
<li>500 ml sour cream</li>
<li>1-2 eggs</li>
<li>Majoran, Muskat, Pepper</li>
<li>Optional:
<ul>
<li>parmesan</li>
<li>chili flakes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start cooking noodles.</li>
<li>First slice, then cube ham into smaller than 1cm¬≥ pieces.</li>
<li>Whip cream in a big bowl.</li>
<li>Add spices, eggs and sour cream to bowl and stir.</li>
<li>Put ham cubes in and stir.</li>
<li>Put noodles without water into bowl and mix.</li>
<li>Put the mixture into one or two baking pans (with baking paper).</li>
<li>Bake at ~160¬∞C for ~2 hours.</li>
<li>Optionally gratin mozzarella or any other cheese on top for 5-10 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>There you have it, an idiot-proof carb and protein bomber that should taste reasonably well. Besides browning the noodles this is really just throwing stuff into a baking pan. This is the kind of dish that tastes better the next day so it's ideal for making on a Sunday and eating for the next 3 or 4 days. Just reheat in oven or pan (add little water).</p>

<p>If you've never made your own sourdough bread, it can be intimidating! But I believe it is absolutely worth the time and effort. You can look up videos to explain some of the methods listed, such as the stretch and fold, or different ways to shape your loaf. Fermenting grains has been a tradition of home cooking for millennia, and an art only lost in recent years. Fermenting grains has numerous health benefits, is much easier to digest, and even contains natural preservatives. You can get a sourdough starter from any bakery in your area, or make your own from scratch! Also, if you don't have a scale, get one!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>100g fed <a href=\"/sourdough-starter\">sourdough starter</a> (levain)</li>
<li>330g warm water</li>
<li>137g bread flour</li>
<li>250g all-purpose flour (avoid bleached and enriched)</li>
<li>87g rye or whole wheat flour</li>
<li>7g sea salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combine sourdough starter with warm water, break apart and dissolve.</li>
<li>Add flour and mix together gently to hydrate. Mixture will be very wet and sticky.</li>
<li>Once there is no dry flour, let stand for 30 minutes (autolyze).</li>
<li>Add sea salt.</li>
<li>Wet hands and begin to stretch and fold dough to combine salt and to begin gluten formation.</li>
<li>Add drops of water until dough becomes cohesive and supple with no toughness or resistance.</li>
<li>Dough will prove on the counter top for 4 - 5 hours. About every 30 minutes, perform a stretch and fold. This involves grabbing the dough with a wet hand, folding over the top of itself, and repeating this step by turning the bowl and making your way around the dough. It will take some practice to work with a dough of this level of hydration, but will get easier!</li>
<li>You will know fermentation is complete when small bubbles are seen on the surface around the edge of your dough. You can also perform a window pane test by grasping a pinch of dough and pulling it between your fingers. The dough should stretch enough to become see-through. This means enough gluten has formed that the dough is strong enough to hold large air bubbles as it bakes.</li>
<li>Turn onto generously floured surface using a bowl scraper or spatula to protect the dough. Handling the dough gently will prevent deflation.</li>
<li>Shape the dough: Take the two sides and fold them into the center of the wet dough. Then, take the top and bottom and fold them also over the center of the wet dough. Optional: grasp the edge of the dough closest to you and roll dough away from you into a tight loaf shape. Generously flour.</li>
<li>Place into a dish about the size of the dough, a proving basket is ideal. Use a lot of flour in the bowl and on the loaf. The sides of the container should not be shallow, the goal here is to let the bread rest in the shape you want it to bake in.</li>
<li>Refrigerate 12 - 24 hours, the longer the dough rests, the more sour your final product. I don't recommend going over 24 hours but sour dough is fun to experiment with!</li>
<li>Bring dough to room temperature, it should feel like a water balloon, giving resistance to touch with some spring.</li>
<li>Put one oven rack in the center and another below it, place a pan of water on the lower rack. Preheat oven to 475 - 500 degrees F, depending on oven capability. The pan of water should create steam to help the bread expand.</li>
<li>When oven is hot, turn bread into a baking vessel. I use a 8 inch springform pan, but a dutch oven is ideal. You can use any vessel that is rated for high temperatures. If using a dutch oven, keep it covered for the first 15 minutes, and you don't need to use the pan of water.</li>
<li>Flour the top of the loaf and score the bread with a razor blade (this is optional but creates an artisan look)</li>
<li>Bake covered/steamed for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 425 F. If using steam, remove the water pan now.</li>
<li>Bake for another 25 - 30 minutes until crust is a rusty color and sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
<li>Let bread cool completely before slicing. (if you can wait!)</li>

This is traditionally made with lamb since it's cheaper however, beef tastes a lot better and is more readily available in North America I've been told. This is good if you want to feed a family or if you just want to be lazy and eat the same thing for 2 or 3 days. Besides browning the meat this is really just throwing stuff into a pot in a certain order. This is the kind of dish that tastes better the next day so it's ideal for making on a Sunday and eating for the next 2 or 3 days.</p>
<p>Serve with mashed potatoes.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lamb shoulder or beef chuck</li>
<li>Onion, celery, carrot and garlic</li>
<li>Thyme, rosemary and some bay leaves.</li>
<li>Beef or <a href=\"/chicken-stock-bone-broth\">chicken stock</a></li>
<li>(Optional) a bottle of stout or porter for some extra flavour.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut up the onion, carrot and celery into bite-sized chunks roughly the same size as the meat. The garlic can go in whole.</li>
<li>Brown the meat on all sides. Get a large pot with some oil and sear the edges of the meat. Do this in batches and try not to overcrowd the pot. Browning the meat on the outside will give it a much nicer texture when you go to eat this and <strong>should not be skipped for convenience</strong>.</li>
<li>Remove the meat and add in the vegetables. Adding some salt will help remove the moisture in the veg and will help deglaze the caramelised bits at the bottom of the pot.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you have a Guinness or some other stout add the meat back in an deglaze with about a third of the can. This will add some extra flavour. Wait until the alcohol has completely evaporated until you stir or continue.</li>
<li>Add back in the meat and add in the stock and herbs. Lower the heat and allow to simmer for about 2 - 2.5 hours.</li>
<li>After 2 hours the stew will be a bit thicker but probably still watery. The easiest thing to do is add some cut up potatoes for the last half hour. The starch will help thicken the stew considerably. Otherwise you can mix a teaspoon of flour with water in a cup and slowly add this to the stew while whisking.</li>

bacon if you want to. Add your seasonings here.</li>
<li>Heat up some butter in a large pan. Add your mix to the pan on high heat.
Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring.</li>

out the whole pan. I recommend a thickness of around 1 - 1.5cm (~1/2&quot;) for a
softer R√∂sti.</li>

R√∂sti.</li>

minutes for browning.</li>

everything in a pan with a bit of water. Use a lid to get the temperature
up.</li>

medium-low. A plate can be useful here, put it on top of the R√∂sti in the
pan and flip. Then gently put the whole cake back in the pan.</li>
<li>When the R√∂sti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two
eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes.</li>
<li>Top R√∂sti with eggs and serve with the peas or spinach.</li>

<li>While they warm up, crumb up the bread. By hand. The smaller, the better. If you're using store-bought crumbs, just put those into a bowl.</li>
<li>Mince the chicken, if necessary. Mince the onions, if you desire them. Divide butter, once softened, into medium bits.</li>
<li>Add eggs to the meat and put a few into a medium bowl; mix both bowls' contents thoroughly.</li>
<li>Add the spices, salt and/or sauce of your choosing. Some may consider this barbaric, but I found that Heinz's mustard ketchup works exceptionally well with the recipe. They'll come out a tad red, though.</li>
<li>Add the softened-up butter to the XL bowl and mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>MAKE A TEST CUTLET by rolling up a small ball of the mince, then dipping it into the bread, then into the eggs, then into the bread again, compounding the breading slightly between dips. More dips means less leaked butter/juice, but don't overdo it lest you want more bread than meat in your cutlet.</li>
<li>Fry, let cool and then taste the cutlet. (Pozharskiye are very juicy, so liquid in the pan is to be expected.)</li>
<li>If unsatisfied, add more flavoring or throw everything away. If satisfied, repeat step 9. (Most cutlet sizes work well. Haven't tried making giant or tiny ones, though.)</li>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Boneless skinless chicken breast(s)</li>
<li>1/4 stick of butter per chicken breast</li>
<li>Seasoning (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fill a large bowl with enough water to submerge the chicken. Add salt to the water until it's fully saturated. Put the chicken under the water and let it sit for 20-40 minutes at room temperature.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 230¬∞C / 450¬∞F.</li>
<li>Remove the chicken from the water. Rinse it. Dry it. Put it in a roasting pan (you can use a casserole dish, oven-safe skillet, or baking pan too).</li>
<li>Brush the chicken with melted butter. For best results, brush all sides of the chicken breast.</li>
<li>Season with pepper and any optional seasoning. Season with salt last.</li>
<li>Insert the thermometer probe into the thickest part of the smallest breast.</li>
<li>Bake until the internal temperature reaches 68¬∞C / 155¬∞F.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and immediately cover with foil leaving the probe inserted. Let the chicken sit for 10 minutes at room temperature. The chicken will continue to cook. It should reach at least 74¬∞C / 165¬∞F but if it doesn't, see <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/49opyx/cooking_chicken_to_temps_below_165_is_it_safe/\">this reddit post</a> about food safety when cooking chicken to less than 165¬∞F.</li>

<p>This is a quick and easy recipe to prepare delicious chicken fillets that are
juicy on the inside, and crisp on the outside.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>For this recipe I don't use any exact proportions, it's just a matter of cooking
it one time to get a sense of what the ideal proportions for you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chicken fillet(s); I normally use chicken breasts</li>
<li>Wheat flour</li>
<li>Paprika</li>
<li>Garlic powder</li>
<li>Herbes de Provence</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Rinse the chicken fillets.</li>
<li>Remove excess moisture from the fillets by patting them with a paper towel.</li>
<li>If the fillets are too thick, cut them in half.</li>
<li>In a small container, pout enough flour and mix in paprika, garlic powder,
Provence herbs, salt, and black pepper to your liking.</li>
<li>Add a little cooking oil to the pan and heat it up to medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Coat the fillets by rolling them in the wheat mix.</li>
<li>Once the pan is hot, put the fillets on the pan and sear each side for about
5 minutes over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>As a final tip, if your fillet is too thick after all, you can just lower the
heat at the end and cook it for about 2-3 more minutes.</li>
<li>And that's it. Winner winner chicken dinner!</li>

<li>Start heating up water for the pasta.</li>
<li>Heat up a few tablespoons of olive oil over low heat.</li>
<li>Crush several cloves of garlic into the olive oil, add the chilli flakes or chilli peppers and fry them for a short time, while being careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
<li>Add your crushed tomatoes, together with some salt and pepper, increase the heat to medium and let simmer for 10-15 minutes or until it looks nicely thickened.</li>
<li>When the water starts boiling, put a handful of salt into it and then your pasta of choice. Ideally leave the pasta slightly undercooked, because it will go in the hot sauce and finish cooking there.</li>
<li>When the sauce is almost ready, add most of your chopped parsley and stir it around. Save some to top the dish later.</li>
<li>When the pasta is ready (ideally at the same time as the sauce or slightly later), strain it and add it to the sauce, which should be off the heat. If the sauce looks a bit too thick, add some of the pasta water. Mix well.</li>
<li>Add some of the grated cheese of your choice and stir it in.</li>
<li>Serve with some more grated cheese and chopped parsley on top.</li>

<p>You'll need a good-sized lidded pot that can go in the oven for this. But if you don't have that then you can use a large roasting tray with sides and cover it with foil, sealing it as best you can. It's an excellent celebration or Sunday meal.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lamb shoulder, or something similar, like lamb shank, preferably on the bone. Get something that will fit in your pot, with room for vegetables around it. For example, I usually get half a shoulder, 2 ‚Äì 3 lbs, 1 ‚Äì 1.5kg.</li>

<li>rosemary</li>
<li>potatoes (optional)</li>
<li>yoghurt (optional, to serve)</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>On the night before:</em> Mix up some olive oil, the juice of half a lemon, the oregano, the rosemary, and some salt and pepper. Rub this mixture into the meat and leave it in the fridge overnight to marinate.</li>
<li><em>The next day:</em> Heat the oven to 375¬∞F/190¬∞C/gas mark 5.</li>
<li>Break apart the garlic. You can leave the skin on the cloves, or you can peel them, as you prefer. Chop the carrots, leek, onion, the remaining lemon, and the potatoes into chunks.</li>
<li>Arrange the meat in the pot with the vegetables underneath and around it. Pour in any marinating juices, as well as a cup of water.</li>
<li>Cook for 2¬Ω ‚Äì 3 hours. Half way through it's a good idea to check and see if it needs some more water to keep things from burning.</li>
<li>Remove the lid and let the meat brown for a few minutes if you think it needs it.</li>
<li>Pull the meat apart and serve, with yoghurt and fresh bread. You can use the juices as a gravy.</li>

<ol>
<li>Throw your pressure cooker with an open lid onto high heat or turn it onto saute mode if it's electric</li>
<li>Chop up the fat into very small, uniform cubes or strips and begin to saute it in the pressure cooker</li>
<li>Chop up your meat into medium, uniform cubes or strips and add it to the fat</li>
<li><em>Optional</em>: If you are not using red wine as a deglaze in step 7 or are not cooking a large amount (~2+ pounds/~1+ kg) of meat, you may want to add a teaspoon or so of beef bouillon into the pressure cooker to intensify the beef flavor of the gravy</li>
<li>Add a generous amount of salt and pepper to taste along with a tiny pinch of garlic powder and stir (be very conservative with the garlic powder)</li>
<li>Once the meat is sufficiently browned off and there is a nice glaze forming on the bottom of the cooker, deglaze the cooker using hot water or red wine (optional) for more flavor.</li>
<li>Put the top on your pressure cooker and allow the meat to cook for around 30 minutes on low heat while you prepare your mashed potatoes</li>
<li>After half an hour, vent your pressure cooker, remove the lid, and put the cooker back on low heat</li>
<li>Add a small amount of hot water until the liquid in the cooker is a bit more than the amount of gravy you want, then allow it to come to a boil</li>
<li>In a small bowl, mix up some flour with warm water to the consistency of a very runny batter</li>
<li>Very slowly begin adding flour water into the pot while constantly stirring until the gravy thickens and reaches the consistency you desire (it's very easy to overthicken the gravy here, don't overdo it!)</li>

<li>Mash up the potatoes to the chunkiness you desire</li>
<li>While the potatoes are still warm, add a generous amount of butter and shredded cheese and stir</li>

<p>A nice recipe that functions as a delicious and fresh appetizer, best eaten with
some totopos corn chips, especially in a hot summer day.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Here are the ingredients for about two adult portions:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Hass avocados</li>
<li>1/4 medium onion</li>
<li>1 small tomato</li>
<li>Cilantro</li>
<li>1 lime</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, some totopos to eat with.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut the avocados in half, open them and place the pulp in a bowl.</li>
<li>Mash the avocados, add lime juice, mix and mash some more.</li>
<li>Mince the cilantro, tomato and onion and add them to the avocado mix.</li>
<li>Add salt and black pepper to taste and mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>Enjoy fresh with some totopos!</li>

might lose its appetizing color and texture in just some hours.</p>

meat native to South America, or things like shrimp and octopus are best. Season your cubed seafood generously with salt

<li>Heat up butter or oil on pan.</li>
<li>Crack eggs into pan.</li>
<li>Start scrambling with wooden spatula.</li>
<li>Cook until desired dryness.</li>
<li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Scrambled and fluffy</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare as normal.</li>
<li>Crack eggs into pan and let them coagulate maybe twenty or thirty seconds before scrambling.</li>
<li>Use a rubber spatula to sort of scrape the egg towards the center of the pan.
You're pushing the cooked egg towards the center while letting the raw egg spill out to be cooked.
Give the egg a couple seconds to cook before pushing it back towards the center.
The more you scramble the less fluffy the egg will be.</li>
<li>Finish as normal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scrambled eggs are easy to customize. E.g. start by frying any of: onions, bits
of ham, mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, etc., before cracking the eggs in.</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Food processor</li>
<li>Fine mesh strainer</li>
<li>Cast iron skillet</li>
<li>Butchers twine</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 pork Roast</li>
<li>2-3 Tbsp fresh rosemary</li>
<li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>‚Öì cup high quality olive oil</li>
<li>1 lemon</li>
<li>4 oz pancetta or bacon</li>
<li>1 tsp fresh parsley</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 275¬∞F (135¬∞C)</li>
<li>Butterfly the roast by cutting into three parts by cutting into the side starting a third of the way up the roast. When you get to the end of the roast open it up and repeat for the remaining roast. You're opening it up like a pamphlet. Refer to the video linked above if you're confused.</li>
<li>Cover with plastic wrap and beat with meat mallet to pound the pork to an even levelness.</li>
<li>Mince garlic cloves(8) with the rosemary(2 Tbsp). Place into a cold pan with olive oil(‚Öì cup) and zest of lemon(1). Keep lemon for later.</li>
<li>Bring to slow simmer on medium low heat for 2-3 minutes. Strain the herbs making sure to squeeze all excess oil. Reserve oil for later.</li>
<li>Add pancetta/bacon(4 oz) to food processor. Pulse a few times before adding the garlic/rosemary mixture. Process until a smooth paste forms.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper both sides of the roast before placing the roast fat side down and spreading the paste over the roast leaving about a 2 inch gap on one side.</li>
<li>Roll tightly towards the 2 inch gap and use butchers twine to secure the roll. Place a knot every inch or so.</li>
<li>Bake at 275¬∞F (135¬∞C) for 2 hours or until internal temperature reads 135¬∞F (57¬∞C) in the thickest part.</li>
<li>Add olive oil to cast iron skillet and heat on high until ripping hot. Cut remaining lemon in half. Brown all sides of pork roast and lemon using tongs.</li>
<li>Juice the lemon into the remaining oil from the garlic/rosemary herb spread. Add freshly chopped parsley. Whisk with fork until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Slice roast into ¬Ω inch thick slices and top with lemon herb vinaigrette.</li>
</ol>
<h5>A note on ingredient snootiness</h5>
<p>I point out that ingredients need to be fresh, the olive oil high quality, the salt needs to be kosher, and the pepper freshly ground not because I'm some rich snob but because it actually matters. The olive oil is one of the main flavors in this dish and it will taste significantly worse if you cheap out. Herbs, especially rosemary, don't even taste the same when comparing dried to fresh.</p>

<h2>Story</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A poor friar who was on a pilgrimage stopped in the village of Almeirim and knocked on the door of a house. He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make ‚Äúa delicious and filling‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.stone soup‚Äù. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the ironclad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well-cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. So the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouri√ßo (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the people of Almeirim</li>

<p>Medieval beef soup with turnips and turnip greens.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<li>One beef roast</li>
<li>Around three to four large turnips with their greens attached</li>
<li>Two cups of chicken stock</li>
<li>1/10 grams of Saffron</li>
<li>1/4 a stick of butter</li>
<li>A slow cooker</li>
<li>A bowl of warm water.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cube the roast into bite sized pieces and place them in a large skillet with the butter.</li>
<li>Heat the pan on medium-high heat and brown the meat with the melted butter until the outside is evenly cooked, sprinkle with pepper as it browns.</li>
<li>While the meat is browning, cut the greens off the turnips and set them aside. Cut the turnips into bite sized pieces making sure to cut the top and bottom ends off first. If you can not find turnips with their greens still attached Mustard greens can be substituted.</li>
<li>Put the cut up turnips in the slow cooker and pour in the chicken stock.</li>
<li>Take the meat and dump it into the slow cooker drippings and all. If the amount of liquid looks a bit low to you, you can pour in another cup or so of water at your discretion.</li>
<li>Sprinkle more pepper over the soup and put the saffron in the bowl of warm water and let it seep for five minutes. Then dump it and the warm water into the soup.</li>
<li>Cut the stems off of the greens and then chop the greens vertically.</li>
<li>Cook the soup on high for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the turnip and meat are soft and tender. About 20 minutes before it is to be done take the chopped greens and put them in the soup. Don't worry if it overfills the slow cooker, the greens will shrink a ton. Cook for about 20 minutes until done.</li>
<li>Taste the soup, if it's still too bland you can add spices of your choice and season to your taste.</li>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>for 1 liter of Gl√ºhwein</p>
<ul>
<li>300 ml Cassis-Juice (Johannesbeer), if you can't find it you can replace it with another juice, I did it e.g. with cranberry pomegranate juice</li>
<li>1 bottle 700ml red wine (I prefer Primitivo/Zinfandel), don't buy a cheap cooking wine, you want to drink it :)</li>
<li>50 g Sugar</li>
<li>25 g Raisins</li>
<li>1 orange</li>
<li>1 cinamon bark</li>
<li>1 spoon ginger powder (or a bit of fresh ginger)</li>
<li>1 spoon cloves</li>
<li>5 star anise</li>
<li>if you don't have the spices you can also just throw in sweet cinamon tea bags instead (or similar), they contain most spices - I took 6 teabags for 1 litre</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>cut the orange in nice looking pieces (since they are mainly decoration)</li>
<li>throw everything in a pot</li>
<li>warm up (don't boil)</li>
<li>enjoy</li>

<p>A sweet and refreshing milkshake that barely requires any effort to make. You're
not required to make it and drink it on Sunday, it was just almost a tradition
in my family to make it on the weekends, and it somehow does taste better on a
Saturday or Sunday morning.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>These are for about 4 glasses or 1 liter:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 banana (or 2 if they are small)</li>
<li>~120 grams of berries. Can be any berries you like.</li>
<li>&lt;1 liter of milk</li>
<li>Vanilla</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Chop the banana so that it fits better in the blender.</li>
<li>Add the banana pieces, berries, vanilla and sugar to taste to the blender.
Usually I use about 6 tea spoons of sugar.</li>
<li>Pour enough milk so that the mix fills a liter of the blender volume.</li>
<li>Blend it until the mix looks somewhat homogeneous.</li>
<li>Pour it and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically anything is better consumed fresh, but it is especially the case for
this milkshake recipe. If you leave it sitting for more than 10-15 minutes it
won't be so delicious anymore.</p>
